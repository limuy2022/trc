# Trc

## Trc is a stack-based programming language

Trc's syntax is easy,and have full toolchain. It is easy to learn modern c++ and compiler,too.

## language

100% C++

Using c++ 20 standard and use module feature

But here is a developing ```rust``` instance now!

[rust_trc](rust/)

## Goal

**as easy as Python**

**as fast as Java**

**as small as lua**

## How to compile

[Compilation guide](doc/developer/build.md)

## International

trc support many languagesï¼Œthe way to change language is that uses the language's dynamic linked library to replace the original language library

## Simple examples

### hello world

```go
println("hello world!")
```

### calculate even numbers from 1 to n

```go
a := int(input())
while a > 0 {
    if a %2 == 0{
        println(a)
    }
    a = a- 1
}
```

### Big num calculation

```go
a := 1231234561234
b := a
println(a)
println(b)
println(a + b)
c := a - b
println(c)
del "c"
println(a * b)
```
