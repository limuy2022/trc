# Common Questions

## Q:Windows 7/Windows XP and platforms that is lower than Windows 10 cannot print info with colors and even print wrong characters

## A:Color info is printed by using ANSI feature，ANSI on Windows is open by enabling virtual terminal(windows 10 added)，so os that is lower than Windows 10 cannot use this feature.We don't have a good solution for this，because trc won't support os this is ended support.Bur expect this feature,other core features won't be affected.
