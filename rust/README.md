# A new instance of Trc language

## using language is 100% rust

Rust's modern and safe features make me very intesested in it and decided to learn it by developing this project.

So this is just an experimental project and I will keep develop c++ version and rust version(maybe more kinds of compilers developing by other languages will be added in future)

## Build

Like other common rust project.Just use ```cargo build```

Running tests is like other rust project,too.Just ```cargo test```
But in order to read test data file,please run in the root dir.

## How to use

[Trc user Guide](docs/usage.md)

## Provide translation for this project

The project use GNU Gettext lib tool to provide I18N(Internationalization) and L10N(localiation) support for the Trc.

If you want to help us to add more translation,please see [Trc translation Guide](docs/developer/translation.md)
