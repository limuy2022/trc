## using language is 100% rust

As a modern language,rust provide us a lot of useful features and I enjoy myself in it.So this project is developed by pure rust.

## Build

Like other common rust project.Just use `cargo build`

Running tests is like other rust project,too.Just `cargo test`
But in order to read test data file,please run in the root dir.

## How to use

[Trc user Guide](docs/usage.md)

## Provide translation for this project

The project use rust-i18n to provide I18N(Internationalization) and L10N(localiation) support for the Trc.
