# A new instance of Trc language

## using language is 100% rust

Rust's modern and safe features make me very intesested in it and decided to learn it by developing this project.

So this is just an experimental project and I will keep develop c++ version and rust version(maybe more kinds of compilers developing by other languages will be added in future)

## Build

Like other common rust project.Just use ```cargo build```

Running tests is like other rust project,too.Just ```cargo test```
